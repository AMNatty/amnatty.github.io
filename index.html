            PlutoEngine is a simple modular 2D game engine written in Java.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is primarily designed to power cross-platform desktop games.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rendering engine is built on OpenGL (core profile version 3.3),
            which allows us to use modern rendering techniques (such as programmable shaders)
            while supporting older machines. At the moment, Vulkan support is not planned.

            Unity
          </h2>
          <p>
            Unity is a game engine that supports both 2D and 3D games
            with a large amount of features and plugins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unity2D has built-in tile and tilemap support, a sprite editor,
            renderer and a sprite atlas API. Sprites are an integral part of
            many 2D games and this should be one of the core features of a 2D
            game engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unity uses C#/Mono as its main scripting language, which in our case
            is nearly impossible to implement as combining Java and C# is very
            difficult.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Godot
          </h2>
          <p>
            Godot is a relatively new open-source game engine written in C++.
            Just like Unity, it comes with its own editor, however it also has
            its own integrated code editor, while in Unity developers usually
            use either VisualStudio, MonoDevelop, or some other C#-compatible
            editor.
          </p>
          <p>
            It features various featues designed for 2D games, such as sprites
            and spritesheets, parallax backgrounds, 2D particles and lights.
          </p>
          <p>
            While equipped for both 2D and 3D graphics, just like Unity,
            Godot seems to be more 2D-oriented than Unity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Godot uses its own scripting language GDScript, however support for
            other languages like C# and C++ is present.

            The PlutoEngine is designed as a set of modules. Each component is usable
            separately with the exception of dependencies (here denoted as arrows),
            which are included transitively.

            LWJGL

          <p>
            The <a href="https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3">Lightweight Java Game Library 3</a>
            is a modular set of libraries providing native access to various APIs, such
            as OpenGL/Vulkan bindings, OpenAL bindings and utilities like
            <a href="https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML">JOML (Java OpenGL Math Library)</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            LWJGL also offers bindings for GLFW, a library simplifying the creation
            of native windows in a platform-agnostic manner.
          </p>
          <h2>
            PlutoLib

          <p>
            For image loading, Java's built-in <code>ImageIO</code> library can be used
            to save development time and avoid adding unnecessary complexity to the codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>PlutoLib</code> should never contain any native code. For that
            reason, <code>stb</code> is included with <code>PlutoStatic</code>.

            This library requires further cleanup as there are too many objects
            created for a single vertex array.

          <h2>
            PlutoMesher & PlutoShader
          </h2>
          <p>
            These libraries provide an abstraction around OpenGL's native functions.
          </p>
          <h3>PlutoShader</h3>
          <p>
            PlutoShader has recently been rewritten to simplify the process
            of loading and using shaders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uniforms are automatically resolved based on their Java field names
            in their shader program class using the Java Reflection API, greatly
            reducing the amount of code written to create a PlutoEngine shader.

            PlutoFramebuffer provides a simple and lightweight abstraction over
            OpenGL's framebuffer objects, streamlining the usage of vertex arrays
            and shaders.

          <h3>
            Sprite API
          </h3>
          <p>
            Each sprite has a 2D texture it belongs. It will be possible
          </p>
          <h3>2D renderer</h3>
          <p>
            The 2D renderer has recently been rewritten to use builder-style
            command chains, removing the need for dozens of function overloads.
          </p>
          <p>
            It works rather well for a small amount of draw calls, however
            more specialized implementations might be needed for some use
            cases, especially world rendering.
          </p>
          <h3>Tiled spritesheets</h3>
          <p>
            Tiled spritesheets provide a simple way to dynamically create
            a single spritesheet, while automatically expanding when full.
            The OpenGL implmentation is backed by a framebuffer, allowing
            the engine to create large stitched textures without leaving
            the GPU's memory.
          </p>
          <h3>Oriented sprites</h3>
          <p>
            Many games require to show certain objects (like the player)
            from multiple sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be easily implemented by either dumping all sides of said
            sprite into a single spritesheet or creating an array texture
            (OpenGL 3.0).
          </p>
          <h3>Temporal sprites</h3>
          <p>
            The same techniques can be used to create animated
            (here called temporal) sprites, with the only exception being
            timers needed to implement animation speed control.
          </p>
          <h3>Temporal oriented sprites</h3>
          <p>
            Finally, some games have sprites that are animated and look
            differently from each side. Despite being a niche use case,
            this feature will probably make it through for the API's
            completness' sake. It should also be relatively easy to implement.
          </p>
          <h3>
            SpriteSkeleton
          </h3>
          <p>
            SpriteSkeleton is an experimental effort to create skeletal animations
            using sprites, but in order to create skeletons, a serialization format
            needs to be created, as defining each "limb" in code would be a very
            tedious task. At the moment, SpriteSkeleton doesn't support skeletal
            animations, making the API somewhat pointless.
          </p>
          <h3>Spritesheet Serialization</h3>
          <p>
            Currently it is impossible to serialize and deserialize
            spritesheets as they are built dynamically on the GPU.
            In order to retrieve the spritesheet, it has to be
            dowloaded from the VRAM back to the main system memory,
            which is not currently implemented in PlutoTexturing.
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, spritesheet serialization is not a priority
            at the moment as there is no editor to benefit from this feature.
          </p>
          <h2>
            PlutoGUI
          </h2>
          <figure>
            <img src="assets/plutogui.png" alt="PlutoGUI library architecture" />
            <figcaption>
              PlutoGUI library architecture, items with dashed borders are awaiting implementation
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            PlutoGUI requires a full rewrite. The font renderer is extremely inefficient
            and by far the slowest part of the engine as each character is treated
            as a single draw call.
          </p>
          <h3>
            New render pipeline
          </h3>
          <p>
            PlutoGUI will receive a new render pipeline, allowing batch rendering
            of GUI components by adding components to a list and then generating
            an optimized list of abstract low-level draw commands, which are
            then interpreted the renderer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Possibly some parts of the planned <a href="#pd-chapter-tile">Tile Engine API</a>
            could be utilized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of draw commands:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go to position &hellip;</li>
            <li>Change UV coordinates to &hellip;</li>
            <li>Switch to sprite &hellip;</li>
            <li>Enable shader effect &hellip;</li>
            <li>Render mesh &hellip;</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>A UI component system</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, if you want to render a complex GUI, you need to use the 2D
            renderer from PlutoSpritesheet and manually handle mouse and keyboard
            events manually, basically forcing you to implement the entire GUI
            yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            A GUI component system would provide a solid abstract foundation for
            creation of complex user interfaces without the need to handle low
            level events.
          </p>
          <h2>
            PlutoAudio
          </h2>
          <p>
            Many games use <b>FMOD</b> or <b>Wwise</b> as their audio engine,
            which are proprietary and unsuitable for an open-source game engine.
            For that reason, PlutoEngine will provide its own sound engine and use
            open formats like OGG/Vorbis and Opus.
          </p>
          <p>
            For an audio API, OpenAL is the most viable and accessible solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because LWJGL currently does not provide means to read Opus codec streams
            from OGG files, only OGG/Vorbis support is planned for the foreseeable future.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Other platforms
          </h2>
          <p>
            PlutoEngine was primarily designed to be a desktop game engine and will
            work across all major operating systems, as long as JVM can be run
            and LWJGL native libraries compile and run on said platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            At least the following platforms will be supported in the full release:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Linux x64
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows x64
            </li>
            <li>
              macOS x64
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Support for aarch64 (ARM64) depends on LWJGL's native libraries,
            especially GLFW.
          </p>
          <h2>
            PlutoCore
          </h2>
          <p>
            PlutoCore is PlutoEngine's main entry point and greatly reduces
            the amount of code to get started.
          </p>
          <h3>The Application API</h3>
          <p>
            The Application API automatically performs all required startup tasks
            to load necessary modules and create the OpenGL context. Programmers
            can focus on writing the game logic itself instead.
          </p>
          <h3>The Stage API</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage.png" alt="PlutoStage's role as an API" />
          </figure>
          <p>
            By far the most important API PlutoEngine has to offer. It is the engine's
            main programmable part also responsible for asset management.
          </p>
          <p>
            A "stage", in this context, is a set of assets bound together by programming logic,
            not necessarily a game level. Stage switching and asset management are handled
            by the engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is still very early into development, the progress can be tracked on <a href="https://github.com/493msi/plutoengine/blob/working/NEXT_RELEASE_DRAFT.md">GitHub</a>.
          </p>
          <h2 id="pd-chapter-tile">
            Tile engine/renderer
          </h2>
          <p>
            Many 2D games are tile-based, meaning the world consists of a tile grid.
            Rendering each tile would be <em>very expensive</em> and wasteful.
            An optimized tile engine can render draw thousands of tiles in a single draw call,
            the only bottleneck being the graphics card's ability to fill pixels.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are multiple approaches to achieve this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="pd-strike">GPU instancing</span>
              (not very suitable for small meshes, such as two triangles forming a quad)</li>
            <li>Rendering each tile to a texture, which would serve as a cache</li>
            <li>Generating meshes on the CPU</li>
            <li><span class="pd-strike">Writing only single coordinates and tile type vertex data, drawing points
              and converting those points to triangles in a geometry shader</span> (This does not save much processing power)</li>
            <li>Uploading the tile IDs to the GPU memory and using a lookup table to determine the tile sprite from a spritesheet</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These approaches can also be combined, but that seems
            to be borderline overengineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            A renderer of this kind may eventually make it into PlutoSpritesheet.

            Editor
          </h2>
          <p>
            Having an editor for each of the engine's features
            is one of the long term goals of the PlutoEngine
            project, but currently there is no reason to have
            one as the stage and particle systems are not implemented
            yet and the Sprite API is still somewhat incomplete.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating an editor would also involve creating proper GUI
            components, which will be unavoidable at some point.
          </p>

            Scripting support
          </h2>
          <p>
            Scripting language support is currently not planned as the engine
            is designed to be modular and anyone can write their own module in
            a JVM-based language (Java, Kotlin, &hellip;).
          </p>
          <p>
            Java's Nashorn JavaScript engine would be a good candidate, however
            is it deprecated.
          </p>
          <p>
            GraalVM is a possible solution for this problem and it requires
            further research.
